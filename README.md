# Docker Image for Shopinvader Wagon

Wagon is the local tool to render and develop the LocomotiveCMS templates.
More information here: https://locomotive-v3.readme.io/docs

This image includes both Wagon and the Shopinvader plugin so you can directly use it without taking care of installing the Ruby stack on your computer.
